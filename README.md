# Supraglacial-debris-thickness-and-supply-rate-in-High-Mountain-Asia
The scripts and functions in this repository support the article Supraglacial debris thickness and supply rate in High-Mountain Asia by McCarthy and others, published in Communications Earth & Environment. They are provided here with input data for Khumbu Glacier, Nepal, as an example. The scripts listed below should be run sequentially to estimate supraglacial debris thickness, supply rate and englacial debris content, according to the Methods described in the article. The scripts were developed using MATLAB 2020b. References are provided in full in the the article in Communications Earth & Environment. Variable and parameter notation is is provided in the article.

To calculate supraglacial debris thickness:
1) run_eb_model
2) calculate_sdt
3) fill_sdt_gaps

To calculate debris-supply rate and englacial debris content:
1) calculate_dsr
